//I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

//P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.


function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
    //return arr1 + arr2; //something went wrong
    
    const sum1 = arr1.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const sum2 = arr2.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    return sum1 + sum2
  }
